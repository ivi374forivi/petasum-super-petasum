```
Start: Do you have a topic to discuss?
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Is it a specific problem to solve?
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Yes: Does it affect multiple repos?
  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Yes: Create an ISSUE in petasum-super-petasum
  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ No: Create an ISSUE in the specific repository
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ No: Continue...
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ Is it a question or idea?
     ‚îú‚îÄ Yes: Start a DISCUSSION
     ‚îî‚îÄ No: Is it an announcement?
        ‚îú‚îÄ Yes: Start a DISCUSSION (Announcement)

## Converting Discussions to Issues

When a discussion reaches a conclusion that requires action:

1. Click **Convert to issue** in the discussion
2. Select the appropriate repository
3. The discussion will be linked to the new issue
4. Apply appropriate labels

## Best Practices

### For Discussion Starters

1. **Choose the right category**: This helps others find your discussion
2. **Use clear titles**: Make it easy to understand the topic
3. **Provide context**: Explain the background and why it matters
4. **Tag relevant people**: @ mention people who should be involved
5. **Mark answers**: If it's a Q&A, mark the helpful answer

### For Discussion Participants

1. **Be respectful**: Follow the organization's code of conduct
2. **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused
3. **Provide value**: Add helpful information or insights
4. **Use reactions**: Upvote helpful comments
5. **Follow up**: Subscribe to discussions you're interested in

### For Moderators

1. **Monitor regularly**: Check for new discussions daily
2. **Categorize**: Move discussions to appropriate categories
3. **Convert to issues**: When action items emerge
4. **Lock resolved**: Lock discussions that have concluded
5. **Pin important**: Pin key discussions for visibility

## Notifications

## Integration with Issues

### Referencing Discussions in Issues

```markdown
See discussion: #123 (if in same repo)
See discussion: owner/repo#123 (if in different repo)
```

### Referencing Issues in Discussions

```markdown
Related to issue: #456
Related to org-wide issue: ivi374forivi/petasum-super-petasum#789
```

## Examples

### Good Discussion Topics

‚úÖ "What CI/CD tools should we standardize on?"
‚úÖ "How can we improve our code review process?"
‚úÖ "Ideas for improving developer onboarding"
‚úÖ "Best practices for API versioning in our org"

### Topics Better Suited for Issues

‚ùå "Login button is broken" ‚Üí Repository-specific issue
‚ùå "Need to update dependencies across all repos" ‚Üí Organization-wide issue
‚ùå "Security vulnerability in authentication" ‚Üí Security issue (possibly private)

## Setting Up Discussion Templates

Create discussion templates in `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/`:

```yaml
# .github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/idea.yml
# Note: Discussion templates may not be supported in all GitHub plans
# and use a different structure than issue templates
title: "[IDEA] "
labels: ["idea"]
```

Example structure (if supported):
```yaml
title: "[IDEA] "
labels: ["idea"]
inputs:
  idea_description:
    description: "Describe your idea"
    required: true
  expected_benefits:
    description: "What are the expected benefits?"
    required: false
  potential_challenges:
    description: "List any potential challenges"
    required: false
  additional_context:
    description: "Any additional context?"
    required: false
```

## Metrics and Insights

Track discussion engagement:

- **Active participants**: Who's contributing?
- **Popular topics**: What's being discussed most?
- **Conversion rate**: How many discussions become issues?
- **Response time**: How quickly are discussions addressed?

## Conclusion

Discussions complement the issue tracking system by providing a space for open-ended conversations, brainstorming, and community engagement before issues are formalized.

Use discussions to explore ideas, ask questions, and build consensus before creating tracked issues.
