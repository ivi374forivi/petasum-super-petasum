owner/repo#123

# Create task list with links
- [ ] owner/repo#123 Implement feature A
- [ ] owner/repo#456 Implement feature B
```

### Searching Issues

## Severity Guidelines

### SEV-1 (Critical)
- **Impact**: Significant business impact
- **Response**: Immediate
- **Examples**: Service outage, data loss, security breach
- **SLA**: Start mitigation within 15 minutes

### SEV-2 (High)
- **Impact**: Major functionality degraded
- **Response**: Urgent, same day
- **Examples**: Performance degradation, partial feature failure
- **SLA**: Begin investigation within 2 hours

### SEV-3 (Medium)
- **Impact**: Minor functionality affected
- **Response**: Important, within 1-2 days
- **Examples**: Non-critical bugs, workaround available
- **SLA**: Acknowledge within 24 hours

## Triage Process

### For Initiatives
1. **Review**: Assess scope and impact
2. **Stakeholders**: Identify affected teams
3. **Resources**: Determine capacity needed
4. **Timeline**: Establish deadlines
5. **Approval**: Get leadership sign-off
6. **Label**: Change from `needs-triage` to `ready`

### For Incidents
1. **Severity**: Assign SEV level
2. **Teams**: Notify affected teams
3. **War Room**: Set up communication channel
4. **Mitigation**: Begin immediate actions
5. **Updates**: Regular status updates
6. **Post-mortem**: Schedule after resolution

### For RFCs
1. **Reviewers**: Identify subject matter experts
2. **Timeline**: Set review period
3. **Discussion**: Gather feedback
4. **Consensus**: Build agreement
5. **Decision**: Accept, reject, or defer
6. **Action**: Convert to initiative or close

## Project Board Workflow

### Status Field Values
- **Backlog**: Accepted but not scheduled
- **Ready**: Prioritized and ready to start
- **In Progress**: Active work
- **Done**: Completed

### Priority Field Values
- **High**: Must be done this quarter
- **Medium**: Should be done this quarter
- **Low**: Nice to have

## Automation Features

### Auto-add to Project
Issues with `org-wide` label automatically added to organization Project

### Notification Rules
Configure GitHub notifications:
- Watch org-issues repository
- Subscribe to specific issues
- Filter by label or assignee

## Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ
- Add `org-wide` label to trigger automation
- Cross-link related issues
- Update status regularly
- Tag relevant teams/people
- Use checklists for tracking
- Document decisions in comments

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Don't create org-wide issues for single-repo concerns
- Don't skip required fields in templates
- Don't forget to update initiative issues when tasks complete
- Don't leave issues open indefinitely
- Don't use SEV-1 for non-critical issues
