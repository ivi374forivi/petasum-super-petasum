### Design Decisions

1. **Form Templates**: Used GitHub's issue form templates (`.yml`) instead of markdown templates for:
   - Better data validation
   - Consistent structure
   - Improved user experience

2. **Label Strategy**: Auto-apply common labels via templates, require manual application for severity:
   - Reduces user error
   - Maintains flexibility for edge cases
   - Enables automation triggers

3. **Separate Documentation**: Created multiple focused documents instead of one large guide:
   - Easier to navigate
   - Specific to use case (setup, reference, examples)
   - Better for different audiences

4. **Minimal Dependencies**: No external dependencies required:
   - Pure GitHub features
   - Easy to adopt
   - No maintenance burden

### Implementation Notes

Based on the `copilot-chat-response-transcript` file (a comprehensive guide on GitHub organization-wide issue management strategies, including best practices, template specifications, and automation patterns) which provided:
- Best practices for organization-wide issue tracking
- Template specifications and field definitions
- Workflow automation patterns
- Architecture recommendations
- Label conventions

The implementation follows GitHub's current best practices for:
- Issue templates (using form syntax)
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Organization Projects (v2)
- GitHub Discussions integration

### Next Steps for Users

1. Customize organization-specific values
2. Create organization Project
3. Configure PAT and secrets
4. Create labels in repository
5. Test templates and workflows
6. Train teams on usage
7. Establish triage processes
