# Organization Commandments

This document outlines the core principles and commandments that guide our organization-wide issue tracking and project management practices. These principles are inspired by best practices from leading open-source projects including Semgrep, TensorFlow, and Schema.org.

## Core Principles

### From Semgrep Philosophy

#### 1. Free & Open Source
- All organizational tools and templates should be freely available and open source
- Empower community involvement and collaboration
- No proprietary barriers to participation

#### 2. Privacy & Security First
- Sensitive information should never leave your organization without explicit consent
- Keep code reviews, discussions, and data within appropriate security boundaries
- Default to secure practices in all workflows and automation

#### 3. Support Many Use Cases
- Templates and workflows should be flexible and adaptable
- If a standard GitHub feature can accomplish something, we should support it
- Accommodate diverse team structures and project types

#### 4. Beginner-friendly & Human-readable
- Documentation should be accessible to newcomers
- Templates should be self-explanatory with clear guidance
- Use plain language over jargon where possible

#### 5. Deterministic & Reliable
- Workflows should produce consistent, predictable results
- Automation should be reliable and fail gracefully
- Given the same inputs, expect the same outputs

#### 6. Safe Execution
- No arbitrary code execution in templates or workflows
- Validate all inputs and outputs
- Use GitHub's native features and well-tested actions

#### 7. Performance Matters
- Keep processes efficient and fast
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Optimize for developer productivity

### From TensorFlow Principles

#### 8. Quality Over Quantity
- Each contribution should meaningfully improve the organization's processes
- Focus on high-impact changes rather than numerous small tweaks
- Prioritize maintainability and long-term value

#### 9. Community Collaboration
- Foster open discussion and consensus-building
- Encourage cross-team collaboration
- Value diverse perspectives and experiences

#### 10. Transparency
- All decisions and changes should be communicated openly
- Document the reasoning behind organizational policies
- Make processes visible and understandable to all

#### 11. Backward Compatibility
- Minimize breaking changes to existing workflows
- Provide migration paths when changes are necessary
- Consider the impact on all stakeholders before major changes

#### 12. Security & Privacy Standards
- Maintain high standards for data privacy and security
- Regularly review and update security practices
- Protect sensitive organizational information

### From Schema.org Standards

#### 13. Interoperability
- Ensure templates and workflows work across different teams and repositories
- Avoid team-specific or tool-specific assumptions
- Design for integration with existing tools and processes

#### 14. Clarity & Precision
- Aim for clear, non-ambiguous definitions in all documentation
- Use consistent terminology across all templates
- Provide examples to illustrate concepts

#### 15. Inclusivity
- Welcome contributions from all organization members
- Lower barriers to participation
- Support contributors at all skill levels

#### 16. Stability
- Changes should not break existing issues or workflows
- Maintain stable interfaces and data structures
- Version major changes appropriately

## Application to Organization-Wide Issue Tracking

These commandments apply to our organization-wide issue tracking practices in the following ways:

### Issue Templates
- **Beginner-friendly**: Templates include clear instructions and examples
- **Clarity**: Required fields are well-defined with validation
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple issue types (initiatives, incidents, RFCs)

### Workflows & Automation
- **Safe Execution**: Use only trusted GitHub Actions
- **Deterministic**: Workflows produce predictable results
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast execution and minimal overhead

### Documentation
- **Transparency**: All processes are fully documented
- **Inclusivity**: Documentation written for all skill levels
- **Interoperability**: Guidance works across different team structures

### Community Practices
- **Collaboration**: Encourage cross-team discussion on org-wide issues
- **Quality**: Focus on high-impact organizational initiatives
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing processes while improving

## Contributing to These Principles

These commandments are living guidelines. As our organization evolves, we should:

1. **Review regularly**: Assess whether these principles still serve us well
2. **Propose changes**: Open discussions or RFCs for amendments
3. **Share learnings**: Document what works and what doesn't
4. **Stay principled**: Use these commandments to guide decision-making
