### 5. Update Configuration Files

#### Update workflow file (`.github/workflows/add-to-org-project.yml`):

```yaml
# Replace this line:
project-url: https://github.com/orgs/your-org/projects/1

# With your actual project URL:
project-url: https://github.com/orgs/acme-corp/projects/1
```

#### Update issue template config (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`):

```yaml
# Replace all instances of 'your-org' with your organization name:
contact_links:
  - name: Propose an idea (Discussions)
    url: https://github.com/acme-corp/org-issues/discussions/new?category=ideas
    about: Start with a discussion for early proposals.
  - name: Security vulnerability
    url: https://github.com/acme-corp/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md
    about: Please follow our security policy.
  - name: Support/help
    url: https://github.com/acme-corp/org-issues/discussions/new?category=support
    about: Use Discussions for Q&A and help.
```

### 6. Create Labels

Create these labels in your repository (Settings → Labels):

| Label | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `org-wide` | `#0E8A16` | Issues affecting multiple repos |
| `initiative` | `#1D76DB` | Cross-team initiatives |
| `epic` | `#5319E7` | Large multi-phase work |
| `rfc` | `#FBCA04` | Request for comments |
| `incident` | `#D93F0B` | Production incidents |
| `sev-1` | `#B60205` | Critical severity |
| `sev-2` | `#D93F0B` | High severity |
| `sev-3` | `#FBCA04` | Medium severity |
| `dependency` | `#0366D6` | Blocked by external dependency |
| `blocked` | `#D93F0B` | Cannot proceed |
| `needs-triage` | `#D876E3` | Needs initial review |
| `ready` | `#0E8A16` | Ready to work on |
| `in-progress` | `#1D76DB` | Currently being worked on |
| `done` | `#5319E7` | Completed |
| `wontfix` | `#FFFFFF` | Will not be addressed |

### 7. Enable GitHub Discussions (Optional)

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Scroll to "Features" section
3. Check "Discussions"
4. Configure discussion categories:
   - Ideas
   - Support
   - Q&A

### 8. Test the Setup

1. Create a test issue using one of the templates
2. Verify it appears in your organization Project
3. Test cross-linking between issues
4. Verify labels are applied correctly

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Templates

Edit template files in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` to:
- Add or remove fields
- Change required validations
- Modify placeholder text
- Adjust labels

### Additional Workflows

Consider adding workflows for:
- Auto-assigning team members based on labels
- Sending notifications to Slack/Teams
- Creating follow-up tasks automatically
- Generating weekly status reports

### Multiple Organizations

If managing multiple organizations:
1. Use separate Projects for each organization
2. Adjust PAT permissions accordingly
3. Consider using separate org-issues repositories

## Troubleshooting

### Issues Not Auto-Adding to Project

- Verify `ORG_PROJECT_TOKEN` secret exists and has correct permissions
- Check workflow logs in Actions tab
- Ensure Project URL is correct
- Verify the PAT hasn't expired

### Templates Not Appearing

- Wait a few minutes after pushing changes
- Check YAML syntax is valid
- Ensure files are in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
- Verify repository has Issues enabled

### Workflow Permissions Error

- Check PAT has both Issues and Projects permissions
- Verify secret is accessible to the repository
- Ensure PAT is for the correct organization

## Maintenance

- Review and update templates quarterly
- Rotate PATs annually or as needed
- Audit label usage and consolidate if needed
- Update documentation as processes evolve
- Archive or close stale org-wide issues

## Support

For questions or issues with this setup:
- Open a discussion in this repository
- Check the README for additional context
- Review GitHub's documentation on issue templates and Projects

## Next Steps

After completing setup:
1. Communicate the new process to your organization
2. Document triage SLAs and ownership
3. Train team leads on using the templates
4. Establish regular review cadences
5. Create a rollout plan for adoption across teams
